Buddi Live Encryption Details
</h1>
<p>
When using Buddi Live, your privacy and data is protected by a number of factors:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Your user ID (email address) is stored as a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function'>cryptographically hashed value</a>.  This means that it is not feasible for anyone to discover your email address by looking at the database.  Note that if you opt to 'Store Email', your email will be stored in plain text in another field.  If you are worried about your privacy, do not click the 'Store Email' option.
</li>
<li>
If you opt to encrypt the data, then certain fields in the database are encrypted using a symmetric-key cryptographic system (currently implemented as 256-bit AES, although this may change in the future).  Fields which are encrypted include Account / Budget Category Name, Account Type, Transaction Description (Payee), Transaction Number (Cheque Number), and Transaction Memo.  Note that the amounts are not encrypted (due to technical limitations); however, since the account ID is hashed, and the account / transaction information is encrypted, the amounts by themselves are meaningless.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note that by enabling encryption, there is no way to reset a lost password.  There are no back doors to the system.  If you forget your password, your data is not recoverable.
