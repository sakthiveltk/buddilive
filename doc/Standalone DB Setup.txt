To create the Derby DB for standalone use, please do the following (assuming *nix system, you may have to adapt for Windows use)

1) From the main Buddi folder (ca.digitalcave.buddi.web), type 'java -jar lib/derbyrun.jar ij' and hit enter.
2) You should see a message along the lines of "ij version 10.9", with a prompt 'ij>'.  Now type
		CONNECT 'jdbc:derby:db/buddi;create=true';
	to create the database.
3) Type each of the DB init commands from the schema.txt file
4) When finished, type "exit;" to end your session.

You should now be able to run Buddi in standalone mode.
